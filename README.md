Project 7 for OpenAI-PythonAPI course - Newspaper headline Translation 

This is project 7 for the OpenAI/PythonAPI course - uses web scraping to gather headlines from foreign language newspapers and translate to English using OpenAI

Notes:

This is a simple example supporting two languages. It could be expanded to include other languages, and other specific sections of the newspaper.
